# Scale up vs Scale out

- **Scale up:** Horizontally. Operation runs on a single instance. Adding power is only possible through the addition of resources in the form of CPU, RAM, or storage to enhance performance.

- A **scale out** Vertically. Operation implies you scale by adding more instances to your existing pool of resources
