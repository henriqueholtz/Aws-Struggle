# AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS)

AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS) is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS that makes it easier to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resiliency. Fault injection experiments are used in chaos engineering, which is the practice of stressing an application in testing or production environments by creating disruptive events, such as a sudden increase in CPU or memory consumption, observing how the system responds, and implementing improvements. Fault injection experiment helps teams create the real-world conditions needed to uncover the hidden bugs, and monitor blind spots, and performance bottlenecks that are difficult to find in distributed systems.

AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS) simplifies the process of setting up and running controlled fault injection experiments across a range of AWS services so teams can build confidence in their application behavior. With AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS), teams can quickly set up experiments using pre-built templates that generate the desired disruptions. AWS Fault Injection Simulator (AWS FIS) provides the controls and guardrails that teams need to run experiments in production, such as automatically rolling back or stopping the experiment if specific conditions are met. With a few clicks in the console, teams can run complex scenarios with common distributed system failures happening in parallel or building sequentially over time, enabling them to create the real-world conditions necessary to find hidden weaknesses.
