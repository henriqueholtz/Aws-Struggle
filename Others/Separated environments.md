# Separated environments

Create separate AWS accounts for development and production environments to receive separate invoices

Every AWS account provides its own invoice end of the month. You can get separate invoices for development and production environments by setting up separate AWS accounts for each environment.

Tag all resources in the AWS account as either development or production. Then use the tags to create separate invoices - You cannot create separate invoices based on tags.
