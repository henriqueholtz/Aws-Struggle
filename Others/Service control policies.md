# Service control policies

Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. Service control policies (SCPs) offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. Service control policies (SCPs) help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines. SCPs are available only in an organization that has all features enabled. SCPs aren't available if your organization has enabled only the consolidated billing features.
