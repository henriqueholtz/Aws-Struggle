# AWS Whitepapers

AWS Whitepapers are technical content authored by AWS and the AWS community to expand your knowledge of the cloud. They include technical whitepapers, technical guides, reference material, and reference architecture diagrams. You can find useful content for your deployment, but it is not a service that will deploy technologies.
