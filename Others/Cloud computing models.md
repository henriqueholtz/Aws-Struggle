# Cloud computing models

Cloud Computing can be broadly divided into three types - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS).

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.

EC2 gives you full control over managing the underlying OS, virtual network configurations, storage, data and applications.

Amazon EC2 is an example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

Elastic Beanstalk is an example of a PaaS service. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an example of Platform as a Service (PaaS).

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. AWS Rekognition is an example of a SaaS service.

Gmail is an example of Software as a Service (SaaS).

## Function as a Service (FaaS)

Function as a service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

AWS Lambda is an example of Function as a service (FaaS).
