# AWS Resource Groups

In AWS, a resource is an entity that you can work with. Examples include an Amazon EC2 instance, an AWS CloudFormation stack, or an Amazon S3 bucket. If you work with multiple resources, you might find it useful to manage them as a group rather than move from one AWS service to another for each task. If you manage large numbers of related resources, such as EC2 instances that make up an application layer, you likely need to perform bulk actions on these resources at one time.

You can use AWS Resource Groups to organize your AWS resources. Resource groups make it easier to manage and automate tasks on large numbers of resources at a time. Resource Groups feature permissions are at the account level. As long as users who are sharing your account have the correct IAM permissions, they can work with the resource groups that you create.
