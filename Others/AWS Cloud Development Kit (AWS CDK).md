# AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.

AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. It also enables you to compose and share your own custom constructs that incorporate your organization's requirements, helping you start new projects faster.

In short, you use the AWS CDK framework to author AWS CDK projects which are executed to generate AWS CloudFormation templates.
