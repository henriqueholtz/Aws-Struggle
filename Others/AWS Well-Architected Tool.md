# AWS Well-Architected Tool

The AWS Well-Architected Tool helps you review the state of your workloads and compares them to the latest AWS architectural best practices. The tool is based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, developed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient application infrastructure.

To use this free tool, available in the AWS Management Console, just define your workload and answer a set of questions regarding operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. The AWS Well-Architected Tool then provides a plan on how to architect for the cloud using established best practices.

The AWS Well-Architected Tool gives you access to knowledge and best practices used by AWS architects, whenever you need it. You answer a series of questions about your workload, and the tool delivers an action plan with step-by-step guidance on how to build better workloads for the cloud.
