# AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, IoT, business intelligence, database, and DevOps. You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer (subscriber) or as a seller (provider), or both. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a consumer and can register to become a seller.
