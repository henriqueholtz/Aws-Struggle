# AWS Marketplace

AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, IoT, business intelligence, database, and DevOps. You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer (subscriber) or as a seller (provider), or both. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a consumer and can register to become a seller.

AWS Marketplace offers two ways for sellers to deliver software to customers:

- **Amazon Machine Image (AMI):** Offering an AMI is the preferred option for listing products in AWS Marketplace. Partners have the option for free or paid products. Partners can offer paid products charged by the hour or month. Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) is also available and enables customers with existing software licenses to easily migrate to AWS.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** If you offer a SaaS solution running on AWS (and are unable to build your product into an AMI) the SaaS listing offers our partners a way to market their software to customers.

AWS Marketplace facilitates:

- Sell Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions to AWS customers
- AWS customer can buy software that has been bundled into customized Amazon Machine Image (AMIs) by the AWS Marketplace sellers
