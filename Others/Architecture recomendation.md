# Architecture recomendation

- Build loosely coupled components

AWS Cloud recommends microservices as an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.

Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features. Each service can be considered as a loosely coupled component of a bigger system. You can use services like SNS or SQS to decouple and scale microservices.
