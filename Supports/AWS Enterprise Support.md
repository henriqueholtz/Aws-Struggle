# AWS Enterprise Support

AWS offers four different support plans to cater to each of its customers - AWS Developer Support, AWS Business Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support and AWS Enterprise Support plans. A basic support plan is included for all AWS customers.

AWS Enterprise Support provides customers with concierge-like service where the main focus is helping the customer achieve their outcomes and find success in the cloud. With AWS Enterprise Support, you get 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage the health of your environment, consultative architectural guidance delivered in the context of your applications and use-cases, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access to proactive/preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts.
