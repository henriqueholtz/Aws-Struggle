# AWS Enterprise Support

AWS offers four different support plans to cater to each of its customers - AWS Developer Support, AWS Business Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support and AWS Enterprise Support plans. A basic support plan is included for all AWS customers.

AWS Enterprise Support provides customers with concierge-like service where the main focus is helping the customer achieve their outcomes and find success in the cloud. With AWS Enterprise Support, you get 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage the health of your environment, consultative architectural guidance delivered in the context of your applications and use-cases, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access to proactive/preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts.

AWS Enterprise Support plan provides 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support however it's costlier than the AWS Business Support plan. You get programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center features to create, manage, and close your support cases, and operationally manage your Trusted Advisor check requests and status. You should note that the AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan also gets programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center.
