## Virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

A software app that runs on a phone or other device and emulates a physical device. The device generates a six-digit numeric code based upon a time-synchronized one-time password algorithm. The user must type a valid code from the device on a second webpage during sign-in. Each virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device assigned to a user must be unique. A user cannot type a code from another user's virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device to authenticate.

Google Authenticator is an example of a Virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device

## U2F security key

## Hardware Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device
