# Credentials Report

You can generate and download a credentials report that lists all users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices. You can use the credentials report to assist in your auditing and compliance efforts. You can use the report to audit the effects of credential lifecycle requirements, such as password and access key rotation. You can provide the report to an external auditor, or grant permissions to an auditor so that he or she can download the report directly.
