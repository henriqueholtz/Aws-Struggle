# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Instance Connect

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect to your Linux instances using Secure Shell (SSH). With EC2 Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances, removing the need to share and manage SSH keys. EC2 Instance Connect will need port 22 to be open for traffic.

All connection requests using Amazon EC2 Instance Connect are logged to AWS CloudTrail so that you can audit connection requests.

You can use Amazon EC2 Instance Connect to connect to your Linux instances using a browser-based client, the Amazon EC2 Instance Connect CLI, or the SSH client of your choice. **Amazon EC2 Instance Connect can be used to connect to an EC2 instance from a Mac OS, Windows or Linux based computer.**
