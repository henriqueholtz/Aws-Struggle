# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Instance Connect

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect to your Linux instances using Secure Shell (SSH). With EC2 Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances, removing the need to share and manage SSH keys. EC2 Instance Connect will need port 22 to be open for traffic.
