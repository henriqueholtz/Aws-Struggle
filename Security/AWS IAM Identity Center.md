# AWS IAM Identity Center

AWS IAM Identity Center is the successor to AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO). It is built on top of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to simplify access management to multiple AWS accounts, AWS applications, and other SAML-enabled cloud applications. In IAM Identity Center, you create or connect, your workforce users for use across AWS. You can choose to manage access just to your AWS accounts, just to your cloud applications, or to both.

You can create users directly in IAM Identity Center, or you can bring them from your existing workforce directory. With IAM Identity Center, you get a unified administration experience to define, customize, and assign fine-grained access. Your workforce users get a user portal to access their assigned AWS accounts or cloud applications.

You can use IAM Identity Center to quickly and easily assign and manage your employeesâ€™ access to multiple AWS accounts, SAML-enabled cloud applications (such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and Box), and custom-built in-house applications, all from a central place.
