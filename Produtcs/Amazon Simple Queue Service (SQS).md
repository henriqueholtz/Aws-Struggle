# Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

- SQS offers two types of message queues - Standard queues vs FIFO queues.
- SQS cannot be used to monitor CPU utilization for EC2 instances or send emails.
