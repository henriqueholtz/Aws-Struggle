# Amazon Sumerian

Amazon Sumerian is a managed service that lets you create and run 3D, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications. You can build immersive and interactive scenes that run on AR and VR, mobile devices, and your web browser. Whether you are non-technical, a web or mobile developer, or have years of 3D development experience, getting started with Sumerian is easy. You can design scenes directly from your browser and, because Sumerian is a web-based application, you can quickly add connections in your scenes to existing AWS services.

Amazon Sumerian leverages the power of AWS to create smarter and more engaging front-end experiences. Easily embed conversational interfaces into scenes using Amazon Lex and embed scenes in a web application using AWS Amplify. Amazon Sumerian embraces the latest WebGL and WebXR standards to create immersive experiences directly in a web browser, accessible via a simple URL in seconds, and able to run on major hardware platforms for AR/VR. Build your scene once and deploy it anywhere.
