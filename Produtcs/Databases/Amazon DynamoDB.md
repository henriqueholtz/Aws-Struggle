# Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-region replication, in-memory caching, and data export tools.

DynamoDB global tables replicate data automatically across your choice of AWS Regions and automatically scale capacity to accommodate your workloads. With global tables, your globally distributed applications can access data locally in the selected regions to get single-digit millisecond read and write performance. DynamoDB offers active-active cross-region support that is needed for the company.

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that supports key-value and document data models and enables developers to build modern, serverless applications that can start small and scale globally to support petabytes of data and tens of millions of read and write requests per second.

Amazon DynamoDB supports both key-value and document data models. This enables Amazon DynamoDB to have a flexible schema, so each row can have any number of columns at any point in time. This allows you to easily adapt the tables as your business requirements change, without having to redefine the table schema as you would in relational databases.

All of your data is stored on solid-state disks (SSDs) and is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones (AZ) in an AWS Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

Amazon DynamoDB cannot be used for online analytical processing.

### Amazon DynamoDB with DynamoDB Accelerator

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory cache that delivers fast read performance for your tables at scale by enabling you to use a fully managed in-memory cache. Using DAX, you can improve the read performance of your DynamoDB tables by up to 10 timesâ€”taking the time required for reads from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second. DAX does not offer active-active cross-Region configuration.
