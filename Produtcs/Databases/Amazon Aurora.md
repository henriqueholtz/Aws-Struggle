# Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora with multi-master cluster - Amazon Aurora (Aurora) is a fully managed relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications. In a multi-master cluster, all DB instances have read/write capability. Currently, all DB instances in a multi-master cluster must be in the same AWS Region.

- You can't enable cross-Region replicas from multi-master clusters.
- Amazon Aurora does not support flexible schema. (requires a well-defined schema.)
