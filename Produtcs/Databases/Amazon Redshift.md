# Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse product designed for large scale data set storage and analysis.

Amazon Redshift does not support flexible schema.

Encryption is an optional setting in Amazon Redshift. When you enable encryption for a cluster, the data-blocks and system metadata are encrypted for the cluster and its snapshots.

It allows you to run complex analytic queries against terabytes to petabytes of structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance storage, and massively parallel query execution.

Amazon Redshift only supports single Availability Zone (AZ) deployments:
