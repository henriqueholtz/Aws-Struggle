# AWS Control Tower

AWS Control Tower is an AWS native service providing a pre-defined set of blueprints and guardrails to help customers implement a landing zone for new AWS accounts.

AWS Control Tower is designed to provide an easy, self-service setup experience and an interactive user interface for ongoing governance with guardrails. While Control Tower automates creation of a new landing zone with pre-configured blueprints (e.g., AWS IAM Identity Center for directory and access), the AWS Landing Zone solution provides a configurable setup of a landing zone with rich customization options through custom add-ons (e.g., Active Directory, Okta Directory) and ongoing modifications through a code deployment and configuration pipeline.
