# AWS CloudTrail

- AWS cloud trail logs has encryption enabled by default.

AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. Think account-specific activity and audit; think CloudTrail. CloudTrail cannot be used to monitor CPU utilization for EC2 instances or send emails.
