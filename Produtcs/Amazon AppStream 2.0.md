# Amazon AppStream 2.0

Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed non-persistent application and desktop streaming service. You centrally manage your desktop applications on AppStream 2.0 and securely deliver them to any computer. You can easily scale to any number of users across the globe without acquiring, provisioning, and operating hardware or infrastructure. AppStream 2.0 is built on AWS, so you benefit from a data center and network architecture designed for the most security-sensitive organizations. This is not a tool for AWS Snowball devices.
