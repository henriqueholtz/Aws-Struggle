AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection. Shield is general protection against DDos attacks for all resources in the AWS network, and not an instance-level security assessment service. Shield cannot be used to check OS vulnerabilities.
