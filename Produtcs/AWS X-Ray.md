# AWS X-Ray

You can use AWS X-Ray to analyze and debug serverless and distributed applications such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.

AWS X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components.
