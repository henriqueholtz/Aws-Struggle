# Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. This is an excellent service for building Resilient systems.

CloudWatch cannot be used to protect from web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

You can create an CloudWatch alarm that sends an email message using Amazon SNS when the alarm changes state from OK to ALARM. The alarm changes to the ALARM state when the average CPU use of an EC2 instance exceeds a specified threshold for consecutive specified periods.

CloudWatch cannot help in identifying the right AWS services to build solutions on AWS Cloud.

It cannot provide the status of your AWS resources.
