# Amazon Cognito

Implement secure, frictionless customer identity and access management that scales

How it works
With Amazon Cognito, you can add user sign-up and sign-in features and control access to your web and mobile applications. Amazon Cognito provides an identity store that scales to millions of users, supports social and enterprise identity federation, and offers advanced security features to protect your consumers and business. Built on open identity standards, Amazon Cognito supports various compliance regulations and integrates with frontend and backend development resources.

Amazon Cognito is a higher level of abstraction than AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). Amazon Cognito supports the same identity providers as AWS STS, and also supports unauthenticated (guest) access, and lets you migrate user data when a user signs in. Amazon Cognito also provides API operations for synchronizing user data so that it is preserved as users move between devices. Amazon Cognito helps create the user database, which is not possible with STS.

With Amazon Cognito, you also have the option to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system.
