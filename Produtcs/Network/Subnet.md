# Subnet

A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your VPC. A subnet spans only one Availability Zone in the Region.

Each subnet must be associated with one NACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a NACL, the subnet is automatically associated with de default NACL (the default NACL allows everything)
