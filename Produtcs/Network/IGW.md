Internet Gateway (IGW)- An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances. Internet Gateway cannot be used to privately connect on-premises data center to AWS Cloud.
