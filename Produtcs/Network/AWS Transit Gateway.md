# AWS Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router â€“ each new connection is only made once. As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways using the AWS global network. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

Transit Gateway is a connectivity service and it does not specialize in data migration.
