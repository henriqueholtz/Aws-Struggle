# AWS Device Farm

AWS Device Farm is an application testing service that lets you improve the quality of your web and mobile apps by testing them across an extensive range of desktop browsers and real mobile devices; without having to provision and manage any testing infrastructure. The service enables you to run your tests concurrently on multiple desktop browsers or real devices to speed up the execution of your test suite, and generates videos and logs to help you quickly identify issues with your app.

Device Farm is designed for developers, QA teams, and customer support representatives who are building, testing, and supporting mobile apps to increase the quality of their apps. Application quality is increasingly important, and also getting complex due to the number of device models, variations in firmware and OS versions, carrier and manufacturer customizations, and dependencies on remote services and other apps. AWS Device Farm accelerates the development process by executing tests on multiple devices, giving developers, QA and support professionals the ability to perform automated tests and manual tasks like reproducing customer issues, exploratory testing of new functionality, and executing manual test plans. AWS Device Farm also offers significant savings by eliminating the need for internal device labs, lab managers, and automation infrastructure development.
