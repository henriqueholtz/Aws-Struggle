# EC2 instance types

## Memory Optimized instance types

Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory. Memory optimized instances offer large memory size for memory intensive applications including in-memory applications, in-memory databases, in-memory analytics solutions, High Performance Computing (HPC), scientific computing, and other memory-intensive applications.

Amazon EC2 R6g instances are the next-generation of memory-optimized instances powered by Arm-based AWS Graviton2 Processors.

## Compute Optimized instance types

Compute Optimized instances are designed for applications that benefit from high compute power. These applications include compute-intensive applications like high-performance web servers, high-performance computing (HPC), scientific modelling, distributed analytics, and machine learning inference.

Amazon EC2 C6g instances are the next-generation of compute-optimized instances powered by Arm-based AWS Graviton2 Processors.

## Storage Optimized instance types

Dense-storage instances are designed for workloads that require high sequential read and write access to very large data sets, such as Hadoop distributed computing, massively parallel processing data warehousing, and log processing applications. The Dense-storage instances offer the best price/GB-storage and price/disk-throughput across other EC2 instances.

## Accelerated computing instance types

Accelerated Computing instance family is a family of instances that use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform some functions, such as floating-point number calculation and graphics processing, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs. Amazon EC2 provides three types of Accelerated Computing instances â€“ GPU compute instances for general-purpose computing, GPU graphics instances for graphics-intensive applications, and FPGA programmable hardware compute instances for advanced scientific workloads.
