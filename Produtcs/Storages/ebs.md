# Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

Designed for mission-critical systems, EBS volumes are replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ) and can easily scale to petabytes of data. You can attach an available EBS volume to one instance that is in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as the volume.

- EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone (AZ).
- EBS is not available as a hardware disk on the instance
- Encryption (at rest and during transit) is an optional feature for EBS and has to be enabled by the user.
