An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures. For this use-case, the computation application itself has a fault tolerant architecture, so it can automatically handle any failures of Instance Store volumes.

As the Instance Store volumes are included as part of the instance's usage cost.
