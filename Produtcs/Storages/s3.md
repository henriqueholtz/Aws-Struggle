#### Amazon S3 storage classes

- S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data;
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns;
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data;
- Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation;

## Amazon S3 Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite. For example: if you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version.

Exam Alert:

Amazon S3 - Amazon S3 is a unique service in the sense that it follows a global namespace but the buckets are regional. You specify an AWS Region when you create your Amazon S3 bucket. This is a regional service.

## Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration

To manage your Amazon S3 objects so that they are stored cost-effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle. With Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration rules, you can tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to less expensive storage classes, or archive or delete them. Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration will do the hard lifting of moving your data into cost-effective storage classes without user intervention. Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration is not meant to protect from accidental deletion of data.

## Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA)

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) takes advantage of Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) cannot be used to protect from accidental deletion of data.
