# [Amazon Simple Storage (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes-infographic/
https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/

- This is a regional service (because of bucket).
- S3 is not available as a hardware disk on the instance
- data encryption automatically enabled
- It is not possible to access S3 directly from on-premises systems.
- 0bytes to 5tb per object;

All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and objects are automatically encrypted by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). This encryption setting applies to all objects in your Amazon S3 buckets.

Amazon S3 is not a good fit for caching information on Amazon EC2 instances.

#### Amazon S3 storage classes

- S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data;
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns;
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data;
- Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation;

## Amazon S3 Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite. For example: if you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version.

Exam Alert:

Amazon S3 - Amazon S3 is a unique service in the sense that it follows a global namespace but the buckets are regional. You specify an AWS Region when you create your Amazon S3 bucket. This is a regional service.

## Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration

To manage your Amazon S3 objects so that they are stored cost-effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle. With Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration rules, you can tell Amazon S3 to transition objects to less expensive storage classes, or archive or delete them. Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration will do the hard lifting of moving your data into cost-effective storage classes without user intervention. Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration is not meant to protect from accidental deletion of data.

There are two types of actions:

Transition actions — Define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to transition objects to the Amazon S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or archive objects to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them.

Expiration actions — Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.

## Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA)

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) cannot be used to protect from accidental deletion of data.

Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) cannot be used to improve the performance of a static website.

## Host an static website on Amazon S3

To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document.

Hosting a static website on Amazon S3:

If you want to configure an existing bucket as a static website that has public access, you must edit block public access settings for that bucket. You may also have to edit your account-level block public access settings. Amazon S3 applies the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level block public access settings.

Here is how you can edit Public Access settings for S3 buckets:

## S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR)

Although Amazon S3 stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones by default, compliance requirements might dictate that you store data at even greater distances. S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) allows you to replicate data between distant AWS Regions to satisfy these requirements.

Exam Alert:

Please review the differences between S3 same-region replication (S3 SRR) and S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR):

## Pricing

There are four cost components to consider for S3 pricing:

- Storage pricing;
- Request and data retrieval pricing;
- Data transfer and transfer acceleration pricing;
- Data management features pricing;

Under "Data Transfer", You pay for all bandwidth into and out of Amazon S3, **except for the following:**

- Data transferred in from the internet;
- Data transferred out to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, when the instance is in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket
- Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront (CloudFront).

#### Extra informations:

- Data transferred in from the internet;
- Data transferred out to an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, when the instance is in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket;
- Amazon S3 is a key value based object storage service;
- Amazon S3 stores data in a flat non-hierarchical structure;

## Amazon S3 Object Lock

You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. It can help you prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. You can use S3 Object Lock to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion.
