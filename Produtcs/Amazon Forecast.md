# Amazon Forecast

Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses machine learning to deliver highly accurate forecasts. Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses machine learning to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no machine learning experience to get started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact your forecasts.

Amazon Forecast can be used to forecast any time-series data, such as retail demand, manufacturing demand, travel demand, revenue, IT capacity, logistics, and web traffic.
