# AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all Regions and accounts. Think infrastructure as code; think CloudFormation. CloudFormation cannot be used to debug performance issues for this serverless application built using a microservices architecture.

- Think infrastructure as code; think CloudFormation.
- Templates JSON or YML;
- CloudFormation Stack sets with AWS Organizations to run in multiple accounts;

This is very different from Beanstalk where you just upload your application code and Beanstalk automatically figures out what resources are required to deploy that application. In AWS CloudFormation, you have to explicitly specify which resources you want to provision.

It cannot be used to automate code deployment.
It cannot be used to automatically deploy code to an Amazon EC2 instance.
