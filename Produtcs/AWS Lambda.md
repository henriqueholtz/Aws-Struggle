# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

With AWS Lambda, you pay only for what you use. **You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute**. AWS Lambda counts a request each time it starts executing in response to an event notification or invoke call, including test invokes from the console. Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms.
