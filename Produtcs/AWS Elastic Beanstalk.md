AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed in a variety of programming languages. You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. You cannot use Beanstalk to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets.
