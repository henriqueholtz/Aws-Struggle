# AWS Config

Think resource-specific history, audit, and compliance; think Config.

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.

With AWS Config, you can do the following:

1. Evaluate your AWS resource configurations for desired settings.
2. Get a snapshot of the current configurations of the supported resources that are associated with your AWS account.
3. Retrieve configurations of one or more resources that exist in your account.
4. Retrieve historical configurations of one or more resources.
5. Receive a notification whenever a resource is created, modified, or deleted.
6. View relationships between resources. For example, you might want to find all resources that use a particular security group.
