# Amazon Inspector

Monitor the security of instances

Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity. These findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment reports which are available via the Amazon Inspector console or API.

Its a security assessment service and not an infrastructure tracking service.

Amazon Inspector cannot be used to prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.

Inspector does not offer any recommendations vis-a-vis AWS best practices for cost optimization, security, and performance improvement.

It cannot provide the status of your AWS resources.
