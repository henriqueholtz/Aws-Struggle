# AWS Snowcone

AWS Snowcone is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing, edge storage, and data transfer devices. Weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg), AWS Snowcone is equipped with 8 terabytes of usable storage, while AWS Snowcone Solid State Drive (SSD) supports 14 terabytes of usable storage. Both referred to as AWS Snowcone, the device is ruggedized, secure, and purpose-built for use outside of a traditional data center. Its small form factor makes it a perfect fit for tight spaces or where portability is a necessity and network connectivity is unreliable. You can use AWS Snowcone in backpacks for first responders, or for IoT, vehicular, and drone use cases. You can execute compute applications at the edge, and you can ship the device with data to AWS for offline data transfer, or you can transfer data online with AWS DataSync from edge locations.

- Ex: is used by the Edge computing applications for IoT use cases for facilitating the collection and processing of data to gain immediate insights and then transfer the data to AWS

Like AWS Snowball, Snowcone has multiple layers of security and encryption. You can use either of these services to run edge computing workloads, or to collect, process, and transfer data to AWS. Snowcone is designed for data migration needs up to 8 terabytes per device and from space-constrained environments where AWS Snowball devices will not fit.
