# Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

It is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan-out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, SMS, and email.
