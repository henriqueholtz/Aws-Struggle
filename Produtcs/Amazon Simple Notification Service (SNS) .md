# Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

It is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fan-out messages to a large number of subscriber endpoints for parallel processing, including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, and HTTP/S webhooks.

Additionally, SNS can be used to fan out notifications to end users using mobile push, SMS, and email.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. The A2A pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, which implies that the receiving applications have to be present and running to receive the messages.
