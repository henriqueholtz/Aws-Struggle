# AWS CodeCommit

- Private GIT of AWS;
- Automatically encrypted at rest through AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) using customer-specific keys;
- Integrates with a lot of services like IAM, Pipeline, etc;

AWS CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. CodeCommit eliminates the need to operate your own source control system or worry about scaling its infrastructure.

It cannot be used to automate code deployment.
