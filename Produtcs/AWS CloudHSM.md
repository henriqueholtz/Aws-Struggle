# AWS CloudHSM

AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. It is a fully-managed service that automates time-consuming administrative tasks for you, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, high-availability, and backups.

CloudHSM cannot be used to prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
