AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. AWS Glue provides all of the capabilities needed for data integration, so you can start analyzing your data and putting it to use in minutes instead of months. You should use AWS Glue to discover properties of the data you own, transform it, and prepare it for analytics.
