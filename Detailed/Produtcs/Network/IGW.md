# Internet Gateway (IGW)

An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances.

You cannot use an Internet Gateway to interconnect your on-premises network with AWS Cloud
