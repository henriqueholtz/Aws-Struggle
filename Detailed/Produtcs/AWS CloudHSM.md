# AWS CloudHSM

- Can be used to generate, use and manage encryption keys;

AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. It is a fully-managed service that automates time-consuming administrative tasks for you, such as hardware provisioning, software patching, high-availability, and backups.

The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual, and regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware Security Module (HSM) instances within the AWS cloud.

AWS CloudHSM allows you to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption in a way that keys are accessible only to you.

CloudHSM cannot be used to prevent Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
