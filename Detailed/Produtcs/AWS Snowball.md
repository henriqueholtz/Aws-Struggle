# AWS Snowball

AWS Snowball is a data transport solution that accelerates moving terabytes to petabytes of data into and out of AWS services using storage devices designed to be secure for **physical transport**.

AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is a data migration and edge computing device. If you have large quantities of data you need to migrate into AWS, offline data transfer with AWS Snowball can overcome the challenge of limited bandwidth, and avoid the need to lease additional bandwidth. AWS Snowball moves terabytes of data in about a week. You can use it to move things like databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data and media content, especially when network conditions prevent realistic timelines for transferring large amounts of data both into and out of AWS.

Transferring data with AWS Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet. However, one Snowball only provides up to 80 TB of capacity
