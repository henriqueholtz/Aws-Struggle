# Amazon Managed Blockchain

Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service that allows you to join public networks or set up and manage scalable private networks using popular open-source frameworks. Amazon Managed Blockchain eliminates the overhead required to create the network or join a public network and automatically scales to meet the demands of thousands of applications running millions of transactions.

While QLDB is a ledger database purpose-built for customers who need to maintain a complete and verifiable history of data changes in an application that they own and manage in a centralized way, QLDB is not a blockchain technology. Instead, blockchain technologies focus on enabling multiple parties to transact and share data securely in a decentralized way; without a trusted, central authority. Every member in a network has an independently verifiable copy of an immutable ledger, and members can create and endorse transactions in the network.
