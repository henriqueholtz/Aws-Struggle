# Amazon Quicksight

Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. QuickSight lets you easily create and publish interactive BI dashboards that include Machine Learning-powered insights. QuickSight dashboards can be accessed from any device, and seamlessly embedded into your applications, portals, and websites.

With Amazon QuickSight, you can quickly embed interactive dashboards into your applications, websites, and portals. QuickSight provides a rich set of APIs and SDKs that allow you to easily customize the look and feel of the dashboards to match applications. With Amazon QuickSight, you can manage your dashboard versions, grant dashboard authoring privileges, and share usage reports with your end-customers. If your application is used by customers that belong to different teams or organizations, QuickSight ensures that their data is always siloed and secure.

Amazon QuickSight has a serverless architecture that automatically scales to tens of thousands of users without the need to set up, configure, or manage your own servers. It also ensures that your users donâ€™t have to deal with slow dashboards during peak-hours when multiple BI users are accessing the same dashboards or datasets. And with pay-per-session pricing, you only pay when your users access the dashboards or reports, which makes it cost-effective for deployments with lots of users. There are no upfront costs or annual commitments for using QuickSight.
