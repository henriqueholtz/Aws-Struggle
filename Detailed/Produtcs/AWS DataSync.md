# AWS DataSync

AWS DataSync is a secure online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying terabytes of data to and from AWS storage services. Easily migrate or replicate large data sets without having to build custom solutions or oversee repetitive tasks. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, or Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

You can use AWS DataSync for ongoing transfers from on-premises systems into or out of AWS for processing. DataSync can help speed up your critical hybrid cloud storage workflows in industries that need to move active files into AWS quickly. This includes machine learning in life sciences, video production in media and entertainment, and big data analytics in financial services. AWS DataSync provides timely delivery to ensure dependent processes are not delayed. You can specify exclude filters, include filters, or both, to determine which files, folders, or objects get transferred each time your task runs.

AWS DataSync employs an AWS-designed transfer protocol—decoupled from the storage protocol—to accelerate data movement. The protocol performs optimizations on how, when, and what data is sent over the network. Network optimizations performed by DataSync include incremental transfers, in-line compression, and sparse file detection, as well as in-line data validation and encryption.
