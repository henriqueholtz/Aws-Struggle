# AWS Artifact

AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to your organization. It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls.

**It is not a service, it's a no-cost, self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS’ compliance reports.**
