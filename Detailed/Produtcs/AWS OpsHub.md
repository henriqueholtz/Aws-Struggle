# AWS OpsHub

AWS OpsHub is a graphical user interface you can use to manage your AWS Snowball devices, enabling you to rapidly deploy edge computing workloads and simplify data migration to the cloud. With just a few clicks in AWS OpsHub, you have the full functionality of the Snowball devices at your fingertips; you can unlock and configure devices, drag-and-drop data to devices, launch applications, and monitor device metrics.

Previously, customers operated Snowball devices by either entering commands into a command-line interface or by using REST APIs. Now with AWS OpsHub, you have an easier way to deploy and manage even large fleets of Snowball devices, all while operating without an internet connection.

AWS OpsHub takes all the existing operations available in the Snowball API and presents them as a simple graphical user interface. This interface helps you quickly and easily migrate data to the AWS Cloud and deploy edge computing applications on Snow Family Devices.

AWS OpsHub provides a unified view of AWS services that are running on Snow Family Devices and automates operational tasks through AWS Systems Manager. With AWS OpsHub, users with different levels of technical expertise can easily manage a large number of Snow Family Devices. With just a few clicks, you can unlock devices, transfer files, manage Amazon EC2 instances, and monitor device metrics.

When your Snow device arrives at your site, you download, install, and launch the AWS OpsHub application on a client machine, such as a laptop. After installation, you can unlock the device and start managing it and using supported AWS services locally. AWS OpsHub provides a dashboard that summarizes key metrics such as storage capacity and active instances on your device. It also provides a selection of the AWS services that are supported on the Snow Family Devices. Within minutes, you can begin transferring files to the device.
