# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers (Lambda is serverless). With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

With AWS Lambda, you pay only for what you use. **You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute**. AWS Lambda counts a request each time it starts executing in response to an event notification or invoke call, including test invokes from the console. Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms.

This functionality makes it an extremely useful service capable of being a serverless backend for websites, data preprocessing, real-time data transformations when used with streaming data, etc.

### Responses

- **AWS Lambda can be used to execute code in response to events such as updates to DynamoDB tables:**

  AWS Lambda can be configured to execute code in response to events, such as changes to Amazon S3 buckets, updates to an Amazon DynamoDB table, or custom events generated by your applications or devices.

- **AWS Lambda can be used for preprocessing of data before it is stored in Amazon S3 buckets:**

  AWS Lambda can be used to run preprocessing scripts to filter, sort or transform data before sending it to downstream applications/services.
