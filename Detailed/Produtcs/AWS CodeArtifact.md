# AWS CodeArtifact

AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that makes it easy for organizations of any size to securely store, publish, and share software packages used in their software development process. CodeArtifact can be configured to automatically fetch software packages and dependencies from public artifact repositories so developers have access to the latest versions. CodeArtifact works with commonly used package managers and build tools like Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet making it easy to integrate into existing development workflows.

Development teams often rely on both open-source software packages and those packages built within their organization. IT leaders need to be able to control access to and validate the safety of these software packages. Teams need a way to find up-to-date packages that have been approved for use by their IT leaders. To address these challenges, IT leaders turn to central artifact repository services to store and share packages. However, existing solutions often require teams to purchase licenses for software solutions that are complex to set up, scale, and operate.

AWS CodeArtifact is a pay-as-you-go artifact repository service that scales based on the needs of the organization. With CodeArtifact there is no software to update or servers to manage. In just a few clicks, IT leaders can set-up central repositories that make it easy for development teams to find and use the software packages they need. IT leaders can also approve packages and control distribution across the organization, ensuring development teams consume software packages that are safe for use.
