# AWS Cloud Pricing

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: **compute, storage, and outbound data transfer**. In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or data transfer between other AWS services within the same region. Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate.

You cannot use this service to forecast your AWS account cost and usage.

AWS also offers a complimentary service called Migration Evaluator (Formerly TSO Logic) to create data-driven business cases for AWS Cloud planning and migration.
