# Inbound & outbound data transfer

- Only outbound data transfer is charged (outbound of region)

One of the main benefits of cloud services is the ability it gives you to optimize costs to match your needs, even as those needs change. AWS services do not have complex dependencies or licensing requirements, so you can get exactly what you need to build innovative, cost-effective solutions using the latest technology.

There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These characteristics vary somewhat, depending on the AWS product and pricing model you choose. Outbound data to the internet from all AWS regions is billed at region-specific, tiered data transfer rates. Inbound data transfer into all AWS regions from the internet is free.
