- **AWS Shield** - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection.

- **AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)** - By using AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), you can configure web access control lists (Web ACLs) on your Amazon CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filter and block requests based on request signatures. Besides, by using the AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) rate-based rules, you can automatically block the IP addresses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define.

- **Amazon CloudFront with Amazon Route 53** - AWS hosts Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53 services on a distributed network of proxy servers in data centers throughout the world called edge locations. Using the global Amazon network of edge locations for application delivery and DNS service plays an important part in building a comprehensive defense against DDoS attacks for your dynamic web applications.

How AWS Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF), and Amazon CloudFront with Amazon Route 53 help mitigate DDoS attacks:
