# Access Key ID

- Access Key ID is from an user;

Access keys are long-term credentials for an **IAM user or the AWS account root user**. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).

Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). As a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Access Keys are secret, just like a password. You should never share them.
