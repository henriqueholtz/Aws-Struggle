Reservation alerts are supported for Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon Elasticsearch reservations.

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI): You can use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI) to reserve capacity and receive a discount on your instance usage compared to running On-Demand instances.

Amazon DynamoDB Reserved Capacity: If you can predict your need for Amazon DynamoDB read-and-write throughput, Reserved Capacity offers significant savings over the normal price of DynamoDB provisioned throughput capacity.

Amazon ElastiCache Reserved Nodes: Amazon ElastiCache Reserved Nodes give you the option to make a low, one-time payment for each cache node you want to reserve and, in turn, receive a significant discount on the hourly charge for that node.

Amazon RDS RIs: Like Amazon EC2 RIs, Amazon RDS RIs can be purchased using No Upfront, Partial Upfront, or All Upfront terms. All Reserved Instance types are available for Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines.

Amazon Redshift Reserved Nodes: If you intend to keep an Amazon Redshift cluster running continuously for a prolonged period, you should consider purchasing reserved-node offerings. These offerings provide significant savings over on-demand pricing, but they require you to reserve compute nodes and commit to paying for those nodes for either a 1- or 3-year duration.
