# TAGs

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value

You must activate both AWS generated tags and user-defined tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report

A Cost Allocation Tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level.

AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags, an AWS generated tags and user-defined tags. AWS defines, creates, and applies the AWS generated tags for you, and you define, create, and apply user-defined tags. You must activate both types of tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report.
