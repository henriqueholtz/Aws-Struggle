## [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)

Describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud.

The 6 Pillars:

- **Operational Excellence**: Focuses on running and monitoring systems, and continually improving processes and procedures. Key topics include automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to manage daily operations.
  - Antecipate failure;
  - Makfe frequent, small, reversible changes;
  - Recommends maintaining infrastructure as code (IaC);
  - Perform operations as code
  - Refine operations procedures frequently
  - Learn from all operationalÂ failures
- **Security**: Focuses on protecting information and systems. Key topics include confidentiality and integrity of data, managing user permissions, and establishing controls to detect security events.
- **Reliability**: Focuses on workloads performing their intended functions and how to recover quickly from failure to meet demands. Key topics include distributed system design, recovery planning, and adapting to changing requirements. The 3 pillars: Foundations, Change Management, Failure Management.
- **Performance Efficiency**: Focuses on structured and streamlined allocation of IT and computing resources. Key topics include selecting resource types and sizes optimized for workload requirements, monitoring performance, and maintaining efficiency as business needs evolve.
- **Cost Optimization**: Focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. Key topics include understanding spending over time and controlling fund allocation, selecting resources of the right type and quantity, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
- **Sustainability**: Focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. Key topics include a shared responsibility model for sustainability, understanding impact, and maximizing utilization to minimize required resources and reduce downstream impacts.
